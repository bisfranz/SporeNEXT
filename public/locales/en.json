  "faq-title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
  "faq-1.question": "Why was Spore NEXT created, and what is its long-term future?",
  "faq-1.answer": "<b>Spore NEXT</b> was born out of my love for <b>Spore</b>, one of the first PC games I ever played as a child. As I began studying programming, I decided to create this mod manager as part of that journey. I plan to keep Spore NEXT updated for a long time and potentially expand it to support <b>other games</b> as well. The project is still in an <b>early stage</b>, and I don't currently have a lot of time or resources to update it consistently, but I do my best to maintain and improve it. I also have several ideas I'd like to implement in the future, such as building a dedicated <b>Sporepedia</b>, improving integration and communication with the <a href=\"https://bisfranz.github.io/SporeNEXT\" target=\"_blank\">Spore NEXT</a> website, and providing modders with tools to <b>upload their own mods</b> directly to the launcher.",
  "faq-2.question": "Why is the project called Spore NEXT?",
  "faq-2.answer": "I've always been a big fan of <b>No Man's Sky</b>. By now, we all know how the game was at launch… however, the <b>\"NEXT\" update</b> marked the turning point where the game truly came back to life. In that sense, the name can be seen as a small <b>Easter egg</b> or tribute.",
  "faq-3.question": "What are the requirements to use Spore NEXT Mod Manager?",
  "faq-3.answer": "<b>Windows 10</b> or later, and a working installation of <b>Spore: Galactic Adventures</b>. We don't support the base Spore version or <b>pirated copies</b> of the game.",
  "faq-4.question": "What is the role of Spore ModAPI in the project, and how is it related to Spore NEXT?",
  "faq-4.answer": "<a href=\"https://launcherkit.sporecommunity.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Spore ModAPI</a> is responsible for handling the installation, uninstallation, and loading of mods for Spore. <b>Spore NEXT</b>, on the other hand, is a mod manager designed to make downloading and maintaining mods easier, while also improving the overall user experience. They are two separate projects that communicate with each other. If you have questions or run into issues specifically related to <b>Spore ModAPI</b>, please join its <a href=\"https://discord.com/invite/QR8CjQT\" target=\"_blank\">Discord community</a> for support.",
  "faq-5.question": "Can I be banned for using Spore NEXT or Spore ModAPI?",
  "faq-5.answer": "Absolutely not. EA/Maxis has <b>never</b> implemented an anti-cheat system or punishment policies for <b>modding</b>.",
  "faq-6.question": "Is it recommended to have multiple copies of the game installed?",
  "faq-6.answer": "<b>No</b>. Installing multiple copies of the game is known to cause a wide <b>variety of issues</b>. Try to avoid installing the game on different platforms at the same time—for example, installing it via EA if you already have it on Steam, or via GOG if you already have it on EA.",
  "faq-7.question": "What's a Galaxy Reset?",
  "faq-7.answer": "A galaxy reset is required because all campaign games take place within a <b>single shared galaxy</b>. When certain mods modify core galaxy elements, the changes can only be applied by <b>resetting the entire galaxy</b>. As a result, all existing <b>save games will be lost</b>. When installing a mod that requires a galaxy reset, the Easy Installer will notify you beforehand. The reset is <b>not performed automatically</b>, so you have the opportunity to create a backup of your files if needed before proceeding. To perform a galaxy reset, you can use the built-in option <b>available in the launcher's Mod List</b> to do it quickly. Alternatively, you can <a href=\"https://launcherkit.sporecommunity.com/support/galaxy-reset\" target=\"_blank\">follow this guide</a> to reset the galaxy manually.",
  "faq-8.question": "Spore does not start or crashes on launch",
  "faq-8.answer": "A <b>clean installation of the game</b> fixes the vast majority of issues. We also recommend uninstalling all installed mods (both those listed in Spore NEXT and any custom mods installed using Spore ModAPI). You can also check a guide covering the most common errors at the <a href=\"https://launcherkit.sporecommunity.com/support\" target=\"_blank\">following link</a>.",
  "faq-9.question": "How do I get support or report bugs?",
  "faq-9.answer": "You can reach out via <a href=\"https://discord.com/invite/JqZyyugs5a\" target=\"_blank\">Discord</a> or open an issue on <a href=\"https://github.com/bisfranz/SporeNEXT\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub</a>.",
